# WAN Party (for Fabric)

WAN Party is a free and open-source optimization mod for sharing your LAN world server / normal server without network configuration.  
### Installation

The latest releases of WAN Party are published to our official [Modrinth](wan-part) page. These releases are considered by our
team to be suitable for general use, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

### How to use

To share your LAN world, simply go to "Open to LAN" as usual. The mod should add a "Share to WAN" button. When enabled, it would create an address which other people can join the server with.

### Known Issues
Currently skin loading is buggy so sometimes players would have default skins. One current bypass is using [another mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/offlineskins-fabric) that fixes this.

### Reporting Issues

You can report bugs and crashes by opening an issue on our [issue tracker](https://github.com/pufferffish/wanparty/issues).
Before opening a new issue, use the search tool to make sure that your issue has not already been reported and ensure
that you have completely filled out the issue template. Issues that are duplicates or do not contain the necessary
information to triage and debug may be closed.

Please note that while the issue tracker is open to feature requests, development is primarily focused on
improving hardware compatibility, performance, and finishing any unimplemented features necessary for parity with
the vanilla renderer.
