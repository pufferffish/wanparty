# WAN Party (for Fabric)

WAN Party is a free and open-source optimization mod for sharing your LAN world server / normal server without network configuration.
### Installation

The latest releases of WAN Party are published to our official [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/wan-party) page. These releases are considered by our
team to be suitable for general use, but they are not guaranteed to be free of bugs and other issues.

### How to use

To share your LAN world, simply go to "Open to LAN" as usual. The mod should add a "Share to WAN" button. When enabled, it would create an address which other people can join the server with.

### Known Issues
Currently skin loading is buggy so sometimes players would have default skins. One current bypass is using [another mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/offlineskins-fabric) that fixes this.
